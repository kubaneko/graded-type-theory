Typed/Properties - U is a term? - stuff to decide

UNotInA needs a stronger premise since U l is now a term
    - Typed properties
    - Can be made weaker

Skipped Weakening since I need UNotInA

should I use \ell if l is used? what is the next best 

-- At this point I do not know what I am doing mostly pattern matching

U≢Usuc unsolved metas ?

Prove it from n\neq sucn

fundamental lemma, logical relation for U - LogicalRelation.agda

most stuff cannot be proven

Logical Relation?  

what are lemmas used for

remove TypeLevels TODO = Nat

pattern \w0 = 0

1+ = suc

< for TypeLevel

TypeLev -> LogRelKit - recursion

Universe type?

Things can reduce to universes - similar to nats

-- Logical relation definition - change U to A

for type equ same as for -- Reducibility of Universe

probably do not need Un\neq nsuc

use l' < l in the logical relation

Universe type equality equality is more difficult? - check that they go to same l
    - add something similar to universe term equal

fundamental - exists level 

embeddings of things - 

-- logical relation definition - cumulativity?
